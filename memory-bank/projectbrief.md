# Project Brief: REAutomation2

## Project Overview

REAutomation2 is an intelligent voice-based lead generation system that uses AI orchestration to conduct automated outbound calls for real estate lead qualification and appointment setting.

## Core Mission

Build a cost-effective, scalable voice AI system that can pre-screen leads using local LLM infrastructure and escalate qualified prospects to premium voice interactions, maintaining a target cost of <$0.10 per call.

## Key Requirements

### Technical Requirements

- **Local LLM Infrastructure**: Ollama with Llama 3.1 8B for cost-effective processing
- **Dual-Tier Voice System**: Local TTS (Pipecat) for pre-screening, 11Labs for qualified leads
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: LangGraph-based workflow management
- **Real-time Voice Processing**: Pipecat + Twilio WebRTC integration
- **Intelligent Lead Qualification**: ML-powered scoring and tier escalation

### Business Requirements

- **Cost Control**: <$0.10 per call target with daily budget limits ($50 default)
- **Scalability**: Support up to 5 concurrent calls initially
- **Quality Assurance**: Intelligent conversation flow with objection handling
- **Performance Tracking**: Analytics and metrics for optimization

### Functional Requirements

- Automated outbound calling via Twilio
- Natural conversation handling with context awareness
- Lead qualification scoring and tier escalation
- Appointment scheduling integration
- Real-time call monitoring and analytics

## Success Criteria

1. **Cost Efficiency**: Maintain <$0.10 per call average
2. **Conversion Rate**: Achieve meaningful lead qualification rates
3. **System Reliability**: 99%+ uptime with graceful error handling
4. **Scalability**: Handle increasing call volumes without degradation
5. **User Experience**: Natural, engaging conversations that don't feel robotic

## Project Phases

1. **Foundation** (Weeks 1-2): Local LLM + Pipecat + LangGraph setup
2. **Pre-Screening** (Weeks 3-4): Qualification logic + scoring algorithms
3. **Premium Voice** (Weeks 5-7): 11Labs integration + tier switching
4. **Learning & Optimization** (Weeks 8-10): ML improvements + performance tuning

## Constraints

- GPU requirement: 6GB+ VRAM for local LLM
- Budget controls must be enforced at multiple levels
- Real-time performance requirements for voice interactions
- Integration complexity with multiple external services (Twilio, 11Labs, Ollama)

## Target Users

- Real estate professionals conducting lead outreach
- Sales teams needing automated qualification
- Marketing teams running lead generation campaigns

- **Current Status**: Metrics not yet measurable (voice pipeline incomplete)
- **Bottlenecks Identified**: Audio processing, LLM inference, database queries

## Known Issues & Blockers

### Critical Issues

1. **Voice Pipeline Missing**: Cannot test end-to-end conversations without audio
2. **LLM Performance**: Local inference speed needs optimization for real-time use
3. **Database Schema**: Need to finalize schema before implementing data persistence

### Technical Challenges

1. **Audio Latency**: Real-time voice processing requires careful buffer management
2. **Concurrent Calls**: Resource management for multiple simultaneous conversations
3. **Cost Tracking**: Accurate cost calculation across multiple service providers
4. **Error Recovery**: Graceful handling of service failures during active calls

### External Dependencies

1. **Ollama Setup**: Requires proper GPU configuration and model installation
2. **Twilio Account**: Need active account with phone number for testing
3. **Database Server**: PostgreSQL and Redis servers must be running
4. **11Labs Account**: Premium TTS service for tier escalation testing

## Evolution of Project Decisions

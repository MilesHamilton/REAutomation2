   - Response caching with Redis
   - GPU memory optimization

3. **TASK-003: Database Layer Setup** (4-6 days)
   - PostgreSQL schema design
   - Alembic migrations
   - SQLAlchemy models and repositories
   - Connection pooling

#### Secondary Tasks (Pre-Screening Phase - Weeks 3-4)

4. **TASK-004: Cost Control System** (3-4 days) - Depends on TASK-001, TASK-002
5. **TASK-005: Integration Services** (4-5 days) - Depends on TASK-001, TASK-003
6. **TASK-006: Error Handling & Recovery** (2-3 days) - Depends on TASK-001, TASK-002

7. **TASK-007: Testing Infrastructure** (5-7 days)
8. **TASK-008: Monitoring & Analytics** (3-4 days)
9. **TASK-009: Documentation & Deployment** (2-3 days)

### Immediate Action Items

- Review detailed task specifications in `tasks-remaining/` directory
- Validate external service dependencies (Twilio, Ollama, PostgreSQL, Redis)
- Begin parallel development of TASK-001, TASK-002, and TASK-003
- Set up development environment per dependency requirements

## Active Decisions & Considerations

### Technical Decisions Made

1. **Agent Architecture**: Chose LangGraph over simple state machines for complex conversation flows
2. **Local LLM**: Ollama with Llama 3.1 8B for cost control and privacy
3. **Voice Strategy**: Dual-tier approach (local + premium) for cost optimization
4. **Database Choice**: PostgreSQL for reliability with Redis for caching

### Pending Decisions

1. **TTS Voice Selection**: Need to choose specific voices for local and premium tiers
2. **Conversation Scripts**: Finalize conversation templates and qualification criteria
3. **Error Recovery**: Define specific error handling strategies for voice failures
4. **Monitoring Strategy**: Choose metrics collection and alerting approach
5. **Task Prioritization**: Determine which critical path tasks to start first based on team capacity
6. **External Service Setup**: Finalize configuration for Twilio, 11Labs, and other integrations

## Important Patterns & Preferences

### Code Organization Patterns

- **Separation of Concerns**: Clear boundaries between agents, voice, LLM, and API layers
- **Async-First Design**: All I/O operations use async/await for concurrency
- **Configuration-Driven**: Environment variables control all system behavior
- **Type Safety**: Pydantic models for all data structures and validation

### Conversation Design Principles

- **Natural Flow**: Conversations should feel human-like and engaging
- **Context Awareness**: Agents maintain conversation context across interactions
- **Graceful Degradation**: System continues operating even with component failures
- **Cost Consciousness**: Every decision considers cost impact and optimization

### Development Practices

- **Test-Driven Development**: Write tests for all critical functionality
- **Documentation-First**: Document decisions and patterns as they're made
- **Modular Design**: Components should be independently testable and replaceable
- **Performance Monitoring**: Track key metrics from the beginning

## Current Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge: Real-time Voice Processing

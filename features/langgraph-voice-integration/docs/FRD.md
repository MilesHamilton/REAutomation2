# Feature Requirement Document (FRD)
## LangGraph Orchestration + Pipecat/Twilio Integration

### Feature Overview

**Feature Name:** LangGraph Voice Agent Orchestration Integration  
**Epic:** Voice Processing Pipeline Enhancement  
**Priority:** High  
**Estimated Effort:** 3-4 sprints  

### Business Context

Currently, the REAutomation2 system has two parallel conversation management systems:
1. A sophisticated LangGraph-based agent orchestration system with specialized agents (Conversation, Qualification, Objection Handler, Scheduler, Analytics)
2. A Pipecat/Twilio voice pipeline that handles real-time audio processing but bypasses the agent orchestration

This creates a disconnect where voice calls don't benefit from the intelligent agent routing, qualification scoring, objection handling, and appointment scheduling capabilities that are available for other interaction channels.

### Business Requirements

#### BR-001: Unified Conversation Management
**Requirement:** All voice interactions must flow through the LangGraph agent orchestration system to ensure consistent conversation quality and intelligent routing.

**Business Value:** 
- Improved lead qualification accuracy
- Better objection handling during voice calls
- Seamless appointment scheduling within voice conversations
- Consistent conversation analytics across all channels

#### BR-002: Intelligent Agent Routing
**Requirement:** Voice conversations must dynamically route between specialized agents based on conversation context and user intent.

**Business Value:**
- More natural conversation flow
- Specialized handling for different conversation phases
- Improved conversion rates through targeted agent expertise

#### BR-003: Real-time Tier Escalation
**Requirement:** The system must automatically escalate voice quality (TTS tier) when leads are qualified, maintaining cost efficiency for unqualified leads.

**Business Value:**
- Cost optimization: ~$0.03 per unqualified call vs $0.08 for qualified leads
- Improved conversion rates for qualified leads through premium voice quality
- Automated decision-making reduces manual intervention

#### BR-004: Conversation State Synchronization
**Requirement:** Voice call state must be synchronized with agent workflow state to maintain conversation continuity and enable proper handoffs.

**Business Value:**
- Seamless conversation experience
- Proper context preservation across agent transitions
- Accurate conversation analytics and reporting

### Success Criteria

#### Primary Success Metrics
1. **Agent Utilization Rate:** 100% of voice calls route through agent orchestration
2. **Qualification Accuracy:** Maintain or improve current qualification scoring accuracy
3. **Cost Efficiency:** Maintain <$0.10 per call average cost target
4. **Conversion Rate:** Improve qualified lead conversion by 15-20%

#### Secondary Success Metrics
1. **Response Latency:** Maintain <2 second response time for voice interactions
2. **Call Completion Rate:** Maintain >90% successful call completion rate
3. **Agent Transition Smoothness:** <500ms delay during agent handoffs
4. **System Reliability:** 99.5% uptime for integrated voice pipeline

### User Stories

#### US-001: Intelligent Greeting and Qualification
**As a** potential lead receiving a voice call  
**I want** the AI to intelligently assess my interest and route the conversation appropriately  
**So that** I receive relevant information and don't waste time on irrelevant pitches

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ConversationAgent handles initial greeting and rapport building
- QualificationAgent automatically engages when qualification signals are detected
- Smooth transition between agents without conversation disruption
- Qualification score calculated in real-time during conversation

#### US-002: Objection Handling During Voice Calls
**As a** potential lead with concerns about the service  
**I want** my objections to be addressed by a specialized agent  
**So that** my concerns are properly understood and resolved

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- ObjectionHandlerAgent automatically engages when objections are detected
- Agent has access to full conversation context
- Objection resolution strategies are applied based on objection type
- Seamless return to previous conversation flow after objection resolution

#### US-003: In-Call Appointment Scheduling
**As a** qualified lead interested in the service  
**I want** to schedule an appointment during the voice call  
**So that** I can secure a consultation without additional steps

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- SchedulerAgent engages when scheduling intent is detected
- Real-time calendar availability checking
- Appointment confirmation within the voice call
- Calendar integration and confirmation emails sent automatically

#### US-004: Premium Voice Quality for Qualified Leads
**As a** qualified lead  
**I want** to experience high-quality voice interaction  
**So that** the conversation feels professional and trustworthy

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- Automatic tier escalation when qualification threshold (0.7) is reached
- Seamless transition from local TTS to premium TTS (11Labs)
- No interruption in conversation flow during tier switch
- Cost tracking and budget management maintained

### Constraints and Assumptions

#### Technical Constraints
- Must maintain existing Pipecat/Twilio infrastructure
- Real-time processing requirements (<2s response time)
- Memory and CPU limitations for concurrent call processing
- Network latency considerations for WebSocket connections

#### Business Constraints
- Budget limit of $0.10 per call average
- Maximum 50 concurrent calls
- Integration must not disrupt existing voice pipeline functionality
- Rollback capability required for production deployment

#### Assumptions
- LangGraph orchestration system is stable and performant
- Pipecat pipeline can be modified without breaking existing functionality
- Twilio WebSocket connections remain reliable
- Agent processing time is compatible with real-time voice requirements

### Dependencies

#### Internal Dependencies
- LangGraph orchestration system (AgentOrchestrator)
- Pipecat voice pipeline (PipecatVoicePipeline)
- Twilio integration (TwilioIntegration)
- Cost control system (budget management)
- Monitoring and analytics system

#### External Dependencies
- Twilio WebRTC service availability
- 11Labs API for premium TTS
- Whisper STT service
- Ollama LLM service
- Redis for state management

### Risk Assessment

#### High Risk
- **Real-time Performance:** Agent processing may introduce latency
- **State Synchronization:** Complex state management between voice and agent systems
- **Tier Escalation Timing:** Premature or delayed tier switches could impact cost/quality

#### Medium Risk
- **WebSocket Reliability:** Connection drops during agent transitions
- **Memory Usage:** Increased memory consumption with dual state management
- **Error Handling:** Complex error scenarios with multiple integrated systems

#### Low Risk
- **Agent Logic Compatibility:** Existing agents should work with voice input
- **Cost Tracking:** Existing cost control mechanisms should extend to integrated system
- **Monitoring:** Current monitoring should capture integrated system metrics

### Out of Scope

#### Explicitly Excluded
- New agent types or agent logic modifications
- Changes to Twilio account configuration
- Modifications to LLM model or training
- New TTS providers beyond existing local/11Labs setup
- Mobile app integration
- Multi-language support enhancements

#### Future Considerations
- Video call integration
- Screen sharing capabilities
- Advanced conversation analytics
- Machine learning-based agent routing optimization
- Integration with additional CRM systems

# Gherkin Scenarios (GS)
## LangGraph Orchestration + Pipecat/Twilio Integration

### Feature: Agent-Integrated Voice Processing

#### Scenario: Voice call routes through agent orchestration
```gherkin
Given a voice call is initiated with call_id "test-call-001"
And the Pipecat pipeline is active
And the AgentOrchestrator is initialized
When the user speaks "Hello, I'm interested in your services"
And the speech is transcribed to text
Then the ConversationProcessor should route the input to AgentOrchestrator
And the ConversationAgent should handle the initial greeting
And the response should be generated through the agent system
And the response should be converted to speech via TTS
```

#### Scenario: Fallback to direct LLM when agent orchestration fails
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with call_id "test-call-002"
And the AgentOrchestrator is unavailable
When the user speaks "What services do you offer?"
And the speech is transcribed to text
Then the ConversationProcessor should detect the orchestrator failure
And fallback to direct LLM service
And log the failure for investigation
And continue the conversation without interruption
```

### Feature: Dynamic Agent Routing

#### Scenario: Conversation flows from greeting to qualification
```gherkin
Given a voice call is in progress with ConversationAgent active
And the user has been greeted successfully
When the user says "I'm looking for a real estate agent in downtown"
And the ConversationAgent detects qualification signals
Then the workflow should transition to QualificationAgent
And the QualificationAgent should engage with qualifying questions
And the conversation context should be preserved
And the transition should be seamless to the user
```

#### Scenario: Objection handling interrupts current agent
```gherkin
Given a voice call is in progress with QualificationAgent active
And the qualification process is ongoing
When the user says "This sounds too expensive for me"
And the system detects an objection
Then the workflow should immediately transition to ObjectionHandlerAgent
And the ObjectionHandlerAgent should address the cost concern
And after objection resolution, return to QualificationAgent
And the qualification context should be preserved
```

#### Scenario: Scheduling agent handles appointment booking
```gherkin
Given a voice call is in progress with QualificationAgent active
And the user has been qualified with score > 0.7
When the user says "I'd like to schedule a consultation"
And scheduling intent is detected
Then the workflow should transition to SchedulerAgent
And the SchedulerAgent should check calendar availability
And offer available time slots to the user
And confirm the appointment within the call
```

### Feature: Real-time Tier Escalation

#### Scenario: Automatic tier escalation for qualified leads
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with LOCAL_PIPER TTS tier
And the current qualification score is 0.5
When the QualificationAgent processes user responses
And calculates a new qualification score of 0.8
And the score exceeds the threshold of 0.7
Then the system should trigger tier escalation
And switch TTS provider to ELEVENLABS
And update cost tracking for the new tier
And continue conversation with premium voice quality
And notify the monitoring system of the escalation
```

#### Scenario: Tier escalation respects budget limits
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with LOCAL_PIPER TTS tier
And the daily budget is nearly exhausted
When the QualificationAgent calculates a score of 0.8
And tier escalation is triggered
Then the system should check remaining budget
And prevent escalation if budget would be exceeded
And log the budget constraint decision
And continue with current tier
And alert the operations team
```

### Feature: Conversation State Synchronization

#### Scenario: CallSession and WorkflowContext remain synchronized
```gherkin
Given a voice call is initiated with call_id "sync-test-001"
And both CallSession and WorkflowContext are created
When the ConversationAgent processes user input
And updates the workflow state to QUALIFYING
Then the CallSession.state should be updated to match
And the qualification score should be synchronized
And the agent transition should be recorded in both contexts
And the synchronization should complete within 100ms
```

#### Scenario: State recovery after synchronization failure
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with synchronized state
And a state synchronization operation fails
When the system detects the synchronization failure
Then it should log the error with full context
And attempt to recover the correct state
And rollback any partial updates
And continue the conversation
And alert the monitoring system
```

### Feature: Performance and Latency Management

#### Scenario: Voice response meets latency requirements
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with agent orchestration enabled
When the user speaks for 3 seconds
And stops speaking (VAD detects silence)
Then speech-to-text processing should complete within 800ms
And agent processing should complete within 500ms
And text-to-speech generation should complete within 700ms
And the total response time should be under 2000ms
And the user should hear the AI response
```

#### Scenario: Agent transition completes within performance limits
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with ConversationAgent
When the system determines a transition to QualificationAgent is needed
Then the agent handoff should complete within 500ms
And the context transfer should complete within 100ms
And the new agent should be ready to process input
And no audio gaps should occur during transition
```

### Feature: Error Handling and Resilience

#### Scenario: Graceful handling of agent timeout
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with QualificationAgent processing
When the agent processing takes longer than the timeout limit
Then the system should detect the timeout
And log the timeout error with context
And fallback to ConversationAgent
And provide a generic response to maintain conversation flow
And alert the monitoring system
```

#### Scenario: Recovery from Pipecat pipeline failure
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with integrated agent processing
When the Pipecat pipeline encounters a critical error
Then the system should detect the pipeline failure
And attempt to restart the pipeline
And preserve the conversation state
And notify the user of a brief technical issue if restart fails
And gracefully terminate the call if recovery is impossible
```

#### Scenario: WebSocket connection recovery
```gherkin
Given a voice call is active with Twilio WebSocket connection
When the WebSocket connection is unexpectedly dropped
Then the system should detect the connection loss
And attempt to re-establish the connection
And preserve the call state during reconnection
And resume audio processing when connection is restored
And log the connection issue for analysis
```

### Feature: Cost Management and Optimization

#### Scenario: Cost tracking across tier escalations
```gherkin
Given a voice call starts with LOCAL_PIPER tier at $0.03/call
When the call is escalated to ELEVENLABS tier at $0.08/call
And the call duration is 5 minutes
Then the system should track costs for each tier segment
And calculate total call cost accurately
And update daily budget consumption
And log cost details for reporting
```

#### Scenario: Budget enforcement prevents escalation
```gherkin
Given the daily budget limit is $100
And current spending is $95
When a qualified lead triggers tier escalation
And the escalation would cost an additional $8
Then the system should check budget availability
And prevent the escalation due to budget constraints
And log the budget enforcement decision
And continue with current tier
And alert operations about budget limit reached
```

### Feature: Monitoring and Analytics

#### Scenario: Agent performance metrics collection
```gherkin
Given multiple voice calls are processed through agent orchestration
When agents handle various conversation scenarios
Then the system should collect agent utilization metrics
And track agent transition frequencies
And measure agent response times
And calculate agent effectiveness scores
And store metrics for analysis and reporting
```

#### Scenario: Real-time system health monitoring
```gherkin
Given the integrated voice system is operational
When various system components are processing calls
Then health metrics should be collected in real-time
And performance thresholds should be monitored
And alerts should be triggered for degraded performance
And system status should be available via health endpoints
And metrics should be stored for trend analysis
```

### Feature: Configuration and Administrative Control

#### Scenario: Runtime configuration updates
```gherkin
Given the integrated voice system is running
When an administrator updates the qualification threshold from 0.7 to 0.8
Then the new threshold should be applied immediately
And active calls should use the new threshold for future decisions
And the configuration change should be logged
And no system restart should be required
```

#### Scenario: Emergency fallback activation
```gherkin
Given the integrated voice system is experiencing issues
When an administrator activates emergency fallback mode
Then all new calls should bypass agent orchestration
And use direct LLM processing
And existing calls should complete with current configuration
And the fallback activation should be logged
And monitoring should reflect the operational mode change
```

### Feature: Integration Testing Scenarios

#### Scenario: End-to-end conversation flow with all agents
```gherkin
Given a voice call is initiated for a qualified lead
When the user engages in a complete conversation flow
Then the ConversationAgent should handle the initial greeting
And the QualificationAgent should assess lead quality
And tier escalation should occur when qualified
And the SchedulerAgent should book an appointment
And the AnalyticsAgent should collect conversation metrics
And the call should complete successfully with all data recorded
```

#### Scenario: Multi-call concurrent processing
```gherkin
Given 10 voice calls are initiated simultaneously
When each call processes through agent orchestration
Then all calls should maintain independent state
And agent processing should not interfere between calls
And performance should remain within acceptable limits
And resource utilization should stay within bounds
And all calls should complete successfully
```

#### Scenario: System stress testing under load
```gherkin
Given the system is configured for maximum concurrent calls (50)
When 50 voice calls are active simultaneously
And each call is processing through different agents
Then response times should remain under 2 seconds
And no calls should experience failures
And system resources should not be exhausted
And all agent transitions should complete successfully
And cost tracking should remain accurate for all calls
```

### Feature: Data Consistency and Persistence

#### Scenario: Conversation history preservation across agent transitions
```gherkin
Given a voice call with multiple agent transitions
When the call progresses through ConversationAgent, QualificationAgent, and SchedulerAgent
Then the complete conversation history should be maintained
And each agent should have access to full context
And conversation continuity should be preserved
And final conversation summary should include all interactions
```

#### Scenario: State persistence during system restart
```gherkin
Given active voice calls with agent orchestration
When the system requires a restart for maintenance
Then active call states should be persisted to Redis
And conversation contexts should be saved
And calls should resume after system restart
And no conversation data should be lost
And users should experience minimal disruption
```

### Feature: Security and Privacy Compliance

#### Scenario: Secure handling of conversation data
```gherkin
Given voice calls contain sensitive customer information
When conversations are processed through agent orchestration
Then all conversation data should be encrypted in transit
And stored data should be encrypted at rest
And access should be logged for audit purposes
And PII should be handled according to privacy regulations
And data retention policies should be enforced
```

#### Scenario: Secure API communication between components
```gherkin
Given the integrated system has multiple communicating components
When components exchange data and control messages
Then all API communications should use secure protocols
And authentication should be required for sensitive operations
And authorization should be enforced based on component roles
And communication should be logged for security monitoring

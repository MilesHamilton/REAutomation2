# Functional Requirements Specification (FRS)
## LangGraph Orchestration + Pipecat/Twilio Integration

### System Overview

This document specifies the functional requirements for integrating the LangGraph agent orchestration system with the Pipecat/Twilio voice pipeline to create a unified, intelligent voice conversation system.

### Functional Requirements

#### FR-001: Agent-Integrated Voice Processing
**Description:** The voice pipeline must route all transcribed user input through the LangGraph agent orchestration system instead of directly to the LLM service.

**Inputs:**
- Transcribed user speech (string)
- Call session context (CallSession object)
- Lead data (dictionary)

**Processing:**
- ConversationProcessor receives transcribed text from Whisper STT
- Creates or retrieves WorkflowContext for the call
- Routes input through AgentOrchestrator.process_input()
- Receives AgentResponse with appropriate agent's response

**Outputs:**
- Agent-generated response text
- Updated workflow state
- Agent transition events
- Qualification score updates

**Error Handling:**
- Fallback to direct LLM service if agent orchestration fails
- Graceful degradation with error logging
- Maintain conversation continuity

#### FR-002: Workflow Context Synchronization
**Description:** The system must maintain synchronized state between CallSession (voice pipeline) and WorkflowContext (agent orchestration).

**State Mapping:**
```
CallSession.call_id ↔ WorkflowContext.call_id
CallSession.lead_data ↔ WorkflowContext.lead_data
CallSession.metrics.qualification_score ↔ WorkflowContext.qualification_score
CallSession.state ↔ WorkflowContext.workflow_state
```

**Synchronization Points:**
- Call initiation: Create WorkflowContext from CallSession
- Agent transitions: Update both contexts
- Tier escalation: Sync qualification scores
- Call termination: Final state synchronization

**Consistency Requirements:**
- State updates must be atomic
- No state drift between systems
- Rollback capability for failed updates

#### FR-003: Dynamic Agent Routing
**Description:** The system must route conversations between specialized agents based on conversation context and user intent.

**Agent Routing Logic:**
1. **ConversationAgent (Entry Point)**
   - Handles initial greeting and rapport building
   - Detects qualification signals
   - Routes to QualificationAgent when appropriate

2. **QualificationAgent**
   - Engages when qualification signals detected
   - Calculates real-time qualification score
   - Routes to ObjectionHandler or Scheduler based on response

3. **ObjectionHandlerAgent**
   - Activates when objections detected in any agent
   - Handles objection resolution
   - Returns to previous agent after resolution

4. **SchedulerAgent**
   - Engages when scheduling intent detected
   - Handles appointment booking
   - Confirms appointments within call

5. **AnalyticsAgent**
   - Runs in background for all interactions
   - Collects conversation metrics
   - Updates lead scoring

**Routing Triggers:**
- Intent detection keywords
- Sentiment analysis results
- Qualification score thresholds
- Explicit user requests

#### FR-004: Real-time Tier Escalation
**Description:** The system must automatically escalate TTS quality when leads are qualified while maintaining cost efficiency.

**Escalation Logic:**
```
IF qualification_score >= 0.7 AND current_tier == LOCAL_PIPER:
    TRIGGER tier_escalation(call_id, ELEVENLABS, "qualification")
    UPDATE CallSession.current_tier
    UPDATE cost_tracking
    NOTIFY monitoring_system
```

**Escalation Process:**
1. QualificationAgent calculates score after each interaction
2. Score compared against threshold (0.7)
3. If threshold met, trigger tier escalation callback
4. VoicePipeline.switch_tier() called with new tier
5. Pipecat pipeline updates TTS service
6. Cost tracking updated with new tier pricing
7. Conversation continues with premium voice quality

**Cost Management:**
- Track cost per tier per call
- Enforce daily budget limits
- Alert when approaching budget thresholds
- Prevent escalation if budget exceeded

#### FR-005: Conversation Flow Management
**Description:** The system must manage smooth conversation flow during agent transitions and tier escalations.

**Transition Requirements:**
- No interruption in audio stream during agent handoffs
- Context preservation across agent transitions
- Seamless TTS tier switching without audio gaps
- Conversation history maintained across all agents

**Flow Control:**
1. **Agent Transition Flow:**
   ```
   Current Agent → Decision Point → Route to New Agent → Context Transfer → Continue Conversation
   ```

2. **Tier Escalation Flow:**
   ```
   Qualification Check → Threshold Met → Tier Switch Request → TTS Update → Continue with Premium Voice
   ```

3. **Error Recovery Flow:**
   ```
   Error Detected → Log Error → Fallback to Previous State → Continue Conversation → Alert Monitoring
   ```

#### FR-006: State Persistence and Recovery
**Description:** The system must persist conversation state and support recovery from failures.

**Persistence Requirements:**
- WorkflowContext stored in Redis with call_id as key
- CallSession state synchronized to persistent storage
- Conversation history maintained across system restarts
- Agent transition history logged for debugging

**Recovery Scenarios:**
1. **Agent Orchestrator Failure:**
   - Fallback to direct LLM service
   - Maintain voice pipeline functionality
   - Log failure for investigation
   - Attempt reconnection

2. **Voice Pipeline Failure:**
   - Graceful call termination
   - Save conversation state
   - Notify monitoring system
   - Clean up resources

3. **Partial System Failure:**
   - Identify failed components
   - Route around failed systems
   - Maintain core functionality
   - Alert operations team

#### FR-007: Performance and Latency Management

**Performance Requirements:**
- Total response time: <2 seconds from speech to audio output
- Agent processing time: <500ms per agent interaction

# LangSmith Monitoring Feature

## Overview

This feature implements comprehensive monitoring and observability for the REAutomation2 LangGraph-based agent orchestration system using LangSmith. It provides real-time visibility into agent workflows, conversation flows, cost tracking, and performance metrics.

## Feature Goals

- **Workflow Visibility**: Monitor LangGraph agent transitions and decision paths
- **Performance Tracking**: Track response times, success rates, and bottlenecks
- **Cost Monitoring**: Integrate with existing cost controls to track LLM usage
- **Debugging Support**: Provide detailed traces for conversation flow debugging
- **Analytics Integration**: Enhance existing analytics with LangSmith insights

## Target Users

- **Development Team**: Debug and optimize agent workflows
- **Operations Team**: Monitor system health and performance
- **Business Stakeholders**: Track conversion metrics and cost efficiency

## Success Metrics

- Reduce debugging time by 50% through improved visibility
- Maintain <$0.10 per call cost target with enhanced tracking
- Achieve 99%+ monitoring coverage of agent interactions
- Enable proactive issue detection and resolution
